        <i> example, Affirm seeks to cut credit card companies out of the online shopping process</i> by offering a way 
        for consumers to secure immediate, <b> loans for purchases. While rates can be high,</b> Affirm claims to
         offer a way for consumers with poor or no credit a way to both secure credits and also build their credit histories. Similarly, Better Mortgage seeks to streamline the home mortgage process (and obviate traditional mortgage brokers) with a digital-only offering that can reward users with a verified pre-approval letter within 24 hours of applying. GreenSky seeks to link home improvement borrowers with banks by helping consumers
         <u> entrenched lenders and save on interest </u>by offering <em> promotional periods.</em>
